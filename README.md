# Data Science & Analytics Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is part of my **data science / analytics portfolio**, showcasing hands-on work across data preparation, exploratory analysis, modeling, and insight generation. The labs emphasize not just building models, but **explaining results clearly and translating them into decisions**.

Each notebook is written to be readable, reproducible, and portfolio-ready.
